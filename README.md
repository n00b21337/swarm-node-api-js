# swarm-node-api-js

Call Swarm node API calls from browser while your swarm node is not public

1. Choose port you want to run this on, change it in code
2. Ensure curl and jq are installed on the remote server and accessible in the environment where the Node.js server is running.
3. Run node index.js, preferably with screen option so its stil running after you close the terminal

You can run most endpoints from here (topology and rchash excluded)
